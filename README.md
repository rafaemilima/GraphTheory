# Graph Theory

## About
This repository concerns about the graph theory discipline algorithms required for our second avaliation.

## Group
* Rick Martim Lino dos Santos
* Rafael Em√≠lio Lima Alves

## Structure
The main structure of this repository is: 
* The directory for each algorith with:
  * The .cpp code for each of the chosen algorithms.
  * The input file for each algorithm.
  * The makefile.

## Makefile
The Makefile has only two main commands:
* make: When you are in one of the algorithm directories the "make" command in the prompt will generate the binary file of the application alongside with the .o file.
* make clean: When you declare the "make clean" command in the prompt you will delete all the files generated with the make command, reverting the directory to have only its original files.

## Algorithms

### Dijkistra Algorithm

#### Input Structure
The input for our aproach in dijkstra algorithm it's a first line for the number of verticles and edges followed by a number of lines, corresponding to the number of edges, wich each one is a line for the graph's adjacency list. At the end of those lines we receive in a line two int variables reguading to the start vertex and the destiny vertex.

```

#### Running
For running Dijkistra Algorithm you locate its directory and execute the make for generate its bin. With the bin file `dijkstra` generated, execute the follow command in the prompt:`./dijkstra`, than type your input according to above configuration.

#### Running with file input:
For running Dijkistra Algorithm with our file example input, follow the steps above but in the call of the bin file, type `./dijkstra < your input file name`, so for our input example we have the following `./dijkstra < dijkstraInput`

#### Output example
Our output for Dijkstra Algorithm is a message saying the shortest distance between the two vectors informed.<br>
`The shortest distance between the vertices 1 and 3 is 8`

### Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
#### Input Structure
The input for our aproach in ford fulkerson algorithm it's a first line for the number of verticles and edges followed by a number of lines, corresponding to the number of edges, wich each one is a line for the graph's adjacency list. At the end of those lines we receive in a line two int variables reguading to the start vertex and the destiny vertex.

#### Running
For running Ford Fulkeron Algorithm you locate its directory and execute the make for generate its bin. With the bin file `fordFulkerson` generated, execute the follow command in the prompt:`./fordFulkerson`, than type your input according to above configuration.

#### Running with file input:
For running Ford Fulkerson Algorithm with our file example input, follow the steps above but in the call of the bin file, type `./fordFulkerson < your input file name`, so for our input example we have the following command: `./fordFulkerson < fordFulkersonInput`

#### Output example
Our output for Ford Fulkerson Algorithm is a message saying the maximum flow between the input verticles at the last line of input.<br>
`The maximum flow from vector 0 to vector 4 is: 7`

### Kruskal Algorithm
#### Input Structure
The input for our aproach in Kruskal algorithm it's a first line for the number of verticles and edges followed by a number of lines, corresponding to the number of edges, wich each one is a line for the graph's adjacency list.

#### Output example
Our output for Kruskal Algorithm is a message saying the the edges of our spanning tree formed from our graph, it's important say that those edges keep the same weight of the input.<br>
```
Edges of the Spanning-Tree:
(3, 5)
(0, 4)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
(0, 2)
(0, 3)
(4, 7)
```

### Prim Algorithm
#### Input Structure
The input for our aproach in Prim algorithm it's a first line for the number of verticles and edges followed by a number of lines, corresponding to the number of edges, wich each one is a line for the graph's adjacency list.

#### Output example
Our output for Prim Algorithm is a message that shows the result of the algorithm aplied for each edge as a start point and after that the amount of the edges weights formed by the algorithm.<br>
